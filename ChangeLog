	* New LanguageModel interface with more abstract interface
		- removed dependency on Dasher-specific CAlphabet 

	* The rendering of the mouse, mouse line and mouse position box are
		now handled by the view, rather than DasherInterface or Platform.		
		A few changes to CDasherInterface have been made - some functions
		have been removed. See code comments.
		
	* Clean up DasherView classes - started implementing a push mechanism
		that is view-driven rather than model-driven. Ditched to silly 'force' flag
		on DasherNodes - this was created to stop small nodes initially flashing in 
		and out of view. This has been solved another way
		
	* Win32 CDasherScreen now caches TextSize calls. This was previously taking
		25% runtime, now its negligible

3.2.1

(Note: This version is primarily targetted at the Gnome release cycle, and
so contains relatively few new features for Unix and none for Windows)

General:
A default colour scheme is now included in the core code, so Dasher will
work even without a colour.xml file
atoi() calls now all occur during setup rather than at runtime - should result
in a noticable performance boost

Unix:
GPE target added - see http://gpe.handhelds.org for more information
Ensure that Dasher doesn't try to update itself while shutting down
Work properly in non-UTF8 locales
Extra command-line options. -o causes Dasher to present itself for text entry
into other applications rather than for internal editing. -p causes Dasher to
only open a preferences window (mostly useful for the GPE port). -s causes
Dasher to output newly entered text to stdout.
Fixed a stupid bug that slowed down gnome-vfs operations.
Dasher now accepts a filename on the command line

3.2.0

General:
Added support for variable colour schemes
Multiple languages added
New eyetracker mode
Speech support
Application control features
Control mode allows in-situ editing
Key entry to other applications
Extra options for cursor visibility
Support for multiple alphabet and colour files
Dasher can be started and stopped based on mouse position
Optional outlines around boxes
Y axis values can be scaled for one dimensional mode
Degree of prediction can be altered
Various memory leaks fixed
Pressing F12 recentres the cursor
Rounding errors fixed in probability calculations

Unix:
Cross-platform support improved
Revamped preferences
Integrates with gnome-accessibility framework
File i/o properly checked

3.0.2

General:
Fixed acceleration behaviour around window edges
Implemented keyboard control (available in Windows and GTK2 interfaces)

Windows:
Minor stability issues dealt with

Unix:
GTK2 version now actually usable - do ./configure --with-gtk2 to get it 
to build. Should have most of the functionality of the other interfaces, 
and it's significantly more attractive.

3.0.1

General:
Default alphabet reordered
API documentation added
Font size changeable
Interfaces now use a crosshair within the Dasher canvas
Flicker reduced
One dimensional input mode introduced
Logical position of the mouse pointer can be displayed
All settings should now be saved between runs
Various fixes to improve prediction

Windows:
Windows version can be started and stopped using the space bar rather than the
mouse
Fixed Windows file operations
Import training file should now work
Fix handling of rapid mouse clicks

Unix:
GTK version gettextised for ease of translation
Added experimental GTK2 version

3.0.0

First full release
