3.2.1

(Note: This version is primarily targetted at the Gnome release cycle, and
so contains relatively few new features for Unix and none for Windows)

General:
A default colour scheme is now included in the core code, so Dasher will
work even without a colour.xml file
atoi() calls now all occur during setup rather than at runtime - should result
in a noticable performance boost

Unix:
GPE target added - see http://gpe.handhelds.org for more information
Ensure that Dasher doesn't try to update itself while shutting down
Work properly in non-UTF8 locales
Extra command-line options. -o causes Dasher to present itself for text entry
into other applications rather than for internal editing. -p causes Dasher to
only open a preferences window (mostly useful for the GPE port). -s causes
Dasher to output newly entered text to stdout.
Fixed a stupid bug that slowed down gnome-vfs operations.
Dasher now accepts a filename on the command line

3.2.0

General:
Added support for variable colour schemes
Multiple languages added
New eyetracker mode
Speech support
Application control features
Control mode allows in-situ editing
Key entry to other applications
Extra options for cursor visibility
Support for multiple alphabet and colour files
Dasher can be started and stopped based on mouse position
Optional outlines around boxes
Y axis values can be scaled for one dimensional mode
Degree of prediction can be altered
Various memory leaks fixed
Pressing F12 recentres the cursor
Rounding errors fixed in probability calculations

Unix:
Cross-platform support improved
Revamped preferences

File i/o properly checked

3.0.2

General:
Fixed acceleration behaviour around window edges
Implemented keyboard control (available in Windows and GTK2 interfaces)

Windows:
Minor stability issues dealt with

Unix:
GTK2 version now actually usable - do ./configure --with-gtk2 to get it 
to build. Should have most of the functionality of the other interfaces, 
and it's significantly more attractive.

3.0.1

General:
Default alphabet reordered
API documentation added
Font size changeable
Interfaces now use a crosshair within the Dasher canvas
Flicker reduced
One dimensional input mode introduced
Logical position of the mouse pointer can be displayed
All settings should now be saved between runs
Various fixes to improve prediction

Windows:
Windows version can be started and stopped using the space bar rather than the
mouse

Fix handling of rapid mouse clicks

Unix:
GTK version gettextised for ease of translation
Added experimental GTK2 version

3.0.0

First full release
