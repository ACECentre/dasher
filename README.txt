Welcome to Dasher version 3.

This source tree is under construction. Please feel free to download the source code, but at the moment we are not able to give support to compile it on your system.

We would appreciate if you would save your feedback until after the first public release, due in the next couple of weeks. We'll also be able to provice documentation on how to port it to your system.

Thanks.
