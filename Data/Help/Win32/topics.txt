	Initially, the characters appear in boxes in a vertical column on the right hand side (figure 1).  Start by clicking the left mouse button near the cross-hair move the pointer towards the first letter you want to write. e.g. 't'.~~\{bmc dasher1.bmp\} ~Figure 1: Initial configuration.~~The display will start to zoom in towards the 't' (figure 2).~~\{bmc dasher2.bmp\} ~Figure 2: Writing 't'.~~~You can stop at any time by clicking on the left mouse button. ~~The horizontal direction controls the rate of zooming in. Moving the pointer to the right zooms in. Moving the pointer to the left zooms out. The vertical co-ordinates determines the place which is being zoomed in on.  As the desired letter moves towards the crosshair, further letters can be selected by searching within the box of the current letter. In figure 3, 'h' is being selected. ~~\{bmc dasher3.bmp\} ~Figure 3: Writing 't' followed by 'h'.~~Always look inside the current letter for the next letter. For example, to write 'the', point at the 'e' within 'h' (figure 4).~\{bmc dasher4.bmp\} ~Figure 4: How to write 'the'.~~An easy mistake to make is to go for the first e you see, and not the 'e' within 't' (figure 5).~~\{bmc dasher5.bmp\} ~Figure 5: How not to write 'the'.~~The text box above the display shows what is being written.

	Training Dasher
	\pard~~Dasher uses two files to learn the language that you're writing.~~The first is <DASHER_DIR>\dasher.rc\training*.txt (the precise file depends on the language), and this is supplied with Dasher. It is responsible for the initial training.~~The second is c:\Documents and Settings\<USERNAME>\Application Data\dasher.rc\training*.txt. This contains text that you have written while using Dasher, allowing it to learn new words and your style of writing. Over time, Dasher will adapt to you in order to allow you to write faster.~

This works well in one dimensional mode.~~{\b Draw mouse line}~Dasher will draw a line between the crosshairs and the current logical pointer position~~{\b Use preferred colours}~Dasher will automatically switch colour scheme to the one defined in the alphabet file for the chosen alphabet
