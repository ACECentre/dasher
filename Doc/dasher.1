.TH DASHER "1" "April 2003" "dasher 3.0.2" "User Commands"
.SH NAME 
dasher \- graphical predictive text entry system

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B dasher
is an information-efficient text-entry interface, driven by
natural continuous pointing gestures. Dasher is a competitive 
text-entry system wherever a full-size keyboard cannot be used.

.SH OPTIONS
.B dasher
takes no command line options.

.SH USAGE
After startup, Dasher will present the user with a window containing two major
sections. The top portion is the edit box - text entered via Dasher will appear
here, and the text may also be edited directly. The bottom portion is the main
Dasher interface and will display a blank background with a column of letters
on the right hand side. Clicking the mouse button will start the model, and the
screen will zoom towards the point underneath the mouse pointer. To select a 
letter, move the mouse pointer into it and watch how it zooms underneat the
crosshair. Within the selected letter, a new column of letters will appear.
Move the pointer over one of these letters to select it as the next letter. To
correct mistakes, move the mouse pointer to the left of the crosshair and 
Dasher will zoom out allowing you to select new letters.

.SH CONVERTING TRAINING FILES TO UTF-8

Dasher requires that training files be in the UTF-8 format, whereas most text
files are likely to be in ISO-8859 format. This doesn't matter for plain text,
but accented characters are encoded differently. In order to convert them, use
the 
.BR iconv (1)
program. For instance, if your training file is in ISO-8859-1 format (Western
European), run

.B iconv -f ISO-8859-1 -t UTF-8 trainingfile >newtrainingfile
