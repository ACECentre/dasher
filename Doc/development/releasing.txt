Dasher Release Instructions
---------------------------

Last Updated 9th Jul 2006 by Phil Cowans.

How to make a Dasher release. Note that most of this only makes sense
if your're the Dasher maintainer, ie me!:

1. Check that Dasher builds!

2. Check that alphabet, colour and training files are up-to-date. Use
   the scripts in /Utils/Linux/Packaging to help.

3. Check that verion numbers are up to date. The following places
   contain version numbers:
   
   a) configure.in

   b) Win32 resources files - both in the 'about' dialogue box and in
   the version information structure.

   c) README

   d) Docs/LICENSE.txt

   e) Inno Setup script

4. Add an item to the ChangeLog and NEWS files

5. Add list of changes to the README file

6. Rebuild the Makefiles

7. Run make distcheck. Fix anything that is broken, and repeat until
   it works.

8. Copy the tarball to a Windows machine, build 'Unicode Release',
   check it works.

9. Build Windows installer package and .debs.

10. Commit to CVS, tag CVS with release.

11. Bump version numbers, commit to CVS again.

12. Copy everything to Inference website, rebuild website.

13. Upload tarball to GNOME servers and install.

14. Send announcement email

15. Update local Inference group repository, run an upgrade on all of
    the machines in the cluster.
