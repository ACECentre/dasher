  /*ACL I'm really not sure where conversion characters should/shouldn't be included.
     They seemed to be included in the Alphabet Map, i.e. for reading training text via GetSymbols;
     but a TODO comment suggested they should _not_ be included in GetNumberSymbols(),
     and I couldn't find any code which would have called e.g. GetText on them.
     Moreover, if these characters are put into the AlphabetMap, they'll be fed into the
     LanguageModel just as any other "symbol", but with an out-of-bounds symbol number!
     (So maybe the range of allowed symbol numbers is wrong?). Hence, not including them atm.
     If they were needed, we could do something like the following:
        if (StartConvertCharacter)
          map->Add(StartConvertCharacter->Text, ++i);
        if (EndConvertCharacter)
          map->Add(EndConvertCharacter->Text, ++i);
