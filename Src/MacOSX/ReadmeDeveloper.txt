To make a dmg for distribution

- create a folder called Dasher-x.y.z where x.y.z is the version of dasher
- put the files to be distributed in this folder.  The files are normally Dasher.app and Readme.html
- run Disk Copy (in Applications/Utilities)
- Drag the Dasher-x.y.z folder onto the Disk Copy window
- call the created dmg file Dasher-x.y.z.dmg
- when it is finished, double-click the Dasher-x.y.z.dmg file and make sure it works
- Dasher-x.y.z.dmg is the file to be distributed
