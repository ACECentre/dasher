TODO

(MISSING - file handling)
- file encoding pref - is that needed on MacOSX, or something different?  see ProjectBuilder Format->File Encodings! for example
- timestamp files pref
- new/open/save/saveas

(MISSING)
- i18n
- help text
- about box
- keyboard control - pref is there, the actual kb handling (arrow keys) is not

(NICE TO HAVE)
- add pref to auto-read training file (and add text field to contain path of training file)
- remember divider position in defaults - is that what EDIT_HEIGHT is about?
- make an image with "paused" in it, display that when it is, yes, paused
- option to make window transparent?
- option to make window float over other windows?

(BUGS, NOT SERIOUS)
- should display displayName rather than fontName in font pref

(ANNOYANCE)
- .inl files are being put in the app under Resources because PB doesn't recognise .inl


(BUGS - Dasher Core)
- at certain sizes (try below about 370 pixels wide), a given frame may contain only rects, no chars.


DONE

30-04-2003
- expat now linked in explicitly rather than with -l, so users don't have to install expat separately
- now handles foreign alphabets correctly; uses stringWithUTF8String rather than stringWithCString in function NSStringFromStdString
- range of speed slider now 0 - 8 to match other implementations

29-04-2003
- editbox no longer crashes in unflush when the number of flushed characters is larger than the number of characters in the edit box.

28-04-2003
- added the parameter_xxx_callback functions; now works correctly if user hasn't any Dasher defaults.
- initialise dasher at the size of DasherView stored in the nib, NOT 10, 10.

26-4-2003
- edit font pref
- speed is correctly set on app startup
- dasher font & font size is selectable in prefs
- put dasher font on appearance; edit font on files, got rid of fonts tab in prefs
- add standard text menus & editing functions for use in edit box

25-4-2003 
- user can select alphabet in preferences
- sets system and user dirs, system dir is resourcePath inside the app; user dir is ~/.dasher/.
- displays the edit text rather than the display text in the edit box 
- kb control pref, but doesn't do anything (the pref is saved and restored correctly)
- app icon added (DasherApp.icns from Iain Murray)
- copy all on stop works
- other clipboard functions implemented, not tested
- dasher font size pref
