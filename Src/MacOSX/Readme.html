<h1>Dasher 3.0.2 for Mac OS X</h1>
<p>
<h3>
WARNING: Dasher 3.0.2 for Mac OS X is beta quality software.  This means it may not always do what it is supposed to do.  In fact, it could mess up files you choose to edit with it.
</h3>
<h4>
You should play around a bit with Dasher on inconsequential files to learn the best way to use it; remember to save often and make backup files.
</h4>
<p>
Dasher is a multi-document text editing application (similar to TextEdit, but with fewer functions), with the additional capability of inputting text using Dasher rather than the keyboard.  An explanation of how to use the Dasher panel is <a href=http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/dasher/Novice.html>here</a>.
</p>
<p>
There are a number of preferences you can adjust on the Dasher Preferences Panel (Dasher->Preferences...).  
</p>
<p>
If you wish to use a non-English alphabet, you may want to pick up a training file for your chosen language.  There are a number of training files on the <a href=http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/dasher/Download.html>website</a>.  Once you've downloaded a training file, you should put it in your own Library/Application Support/Dasher folder (if any of the folders in the path don't exist, just create them).
