Dasher version 3.0.0 preview release 1
--------------------------------------

This release has been provided for the impatient so that you can see
what we have been doing. Please bear in mind that 3.0.0 is a complete
rewrite, and as such some features that were present in 1.6.8 have not
yet been implemented in this version. In particular, the Linux user
interface is very far from complete. The build system has also not
been thoroughly tested - you run 'make install' at your own risk ;)

We'd appreciate any feedback / bug reports / patches - please send
them to dasher@mrao.cam.ac.uk

Yours,

The Dasher Team
