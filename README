Dasher version 3.2.2
--------------------

This is the full release of Dasher 3.2.1. Documentation may be found
in Doc/

In order to compile the Unix code with speech support, pass --with-speech to
configure. In order to compile the Unix code with accessible menu support, pass
--with-a11y to configure. In order to compile the Unix code with Gnome support,
pass --with-gnome to configure.

For Linux PDAs:

Pass --with-gpe to build a GPE version of Dasher. Pass --with-qte to build
a QTopia version of Dasher.

Dasher includes some alphabets which require fonts that you probably don't 
have installed; for example, for the International Phonetic Alphabet, Korean
and Hiragana (Japanese).  We aren't legally allowed to distribute a font for
the IPA, but you can download one yourself from:  
   <http://www.sil.org/computing/fonts/encore-ipa.html>.

We'd appreciate any feedback / bug reports / patches - please send
them to dasher@mrao.cam.ac.uk

Yours,

The Dasher Team
