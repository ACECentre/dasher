Dasher
------
This is a full release of Dasher 3.2.19

Dasher is a zooming predictive text entry system, designed for situations
where keyboard input is impractical (for instance, accessibility or PDAs). It
is usable with highly limited amounts of physical input while still allowing
high rates of text entry.

Documentation may be found in Doc/

We would appreciate any feedback / bug reports / patches - please use the 
'dasher' product in the GNOME bugzilla (http://bugzilla.gnome.org/), or if 
that is not appropriate, email 'dasher@mrao.cam.ac.uk'.

Font Issues
-----------
Dasher includes some alphabets which require fonts that you probably don't 
have installed; for example, for the International Phonetic Alphabet, Korean
and Hiragana (Japanese).  We aren't legally allowed to distribute a font for
the IPA, but you can download one yourself from:
