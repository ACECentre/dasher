Dasher version 3.2.4
--------------------

This is the full release of Dasher 3.2.4. Documentation may be found
in Doc/

Dasher is a zooming predictive text entry system, designed for situations
where keyboard input is impractical (for instance, accessibility or PDAs). It
is usable with highly limited amounts of physical input while still allowing
high rates of text entry.

In order to compile the Unix code with speech support, pass --with-speech to
configure. In order to compile the Unix code with accessible menu support, pass
--with-a11y to configure. In order to compile the Unix code with Gnome support,
pass --with-gnome to configure.

For Linux PDAs:

Pass --with-gpe to build a GPE version of Dasher. Pass --with-qte to build
a QTopia version of Dasher.

Dasher includes some alphabets which require fonts that you probably don't 
have installed; for example, for the International Phonetic Alphabet, Korean
and Hiragana (Japanese).  We aren't legally allowed to distribute a font for
the IPA, but you can download one yourself from:  
   <http://www.sil.org/computing/fonts/encore-ipa.html>.

We'd appreciate any feedback / bug reports / patches - please send
them to dasher@mrao.cam.ac.uk

The Dasher Team
