Dasher version 3.99.0 (4.0 preview 1)
------------------------------------- 
This is Dasher 3.99.0, the first preview release of the upcoming 4.0
series. It is development code, and should therefore be considered
potentially unstable, although we have done our best to make it as
usable as possible.

Dasher is a zooming predictive text entry system, designed for situations
where keyboard input is impractical (for instance, accessibility or PDAs). It
is usable with highly limited amounts of physical input while still allowing
high rates of text entry.

Dasher is Free software released under the GPL. Further documentation
may be found in the Doc/ subdirectory
